/**
 * The single repo-wide gate. One ordered list of checks; `check:all` delegates
 * here, and both the pre-commit hook and CI invoke `check:all` — so one list is
 * the single source of what "green" means everywhere. Add a check here and every
 * caller inherits it.
 *
 * Ordering is cheap-first: a fast Biome failure surfaces before the slower
 * typecheck and test gates run.
 *
 * The checks:
 *   1. biome     — lint + format + import-organize (check-only, no writes). This
 *                  also enforces the discipline rules Biome can express, e.g.
 *                  `noTsIgnore` is set to error in biome.json, so a banned
 *                  suppression directive fails the gate rather than merely warning.
 *   2. typecheck — `tsc --noEmit` over the package.
 *   3. test      — `vitest run`.
 *
 * ADDING A GATE. This is the extension point a project adopting the blueprint is
 * expected to use: append an entry to GATES and every caller (the pre-commit hook,
 * CI, a developer running `npm run check:all`) inherits it with no other edit. Put
 * expensive behavioural checks LAST so the cheap ones fail fast — e.g. a build, an
 * IaC synth, a container smoke test, a schema-compatibility check.
 *
 * Runtime is node — `check:all` runs `node scripts/gate.ts`, and Node strips the
 * TypeScript types at load. Each gate shells out through `npm run <script>`, so a
 * command's definition lives in exactly one place: package.json.

 * Hardcoding `npm` here was a real portability bug: `bun scripts/gate.ts` runs the TypeScript fine
 * (Bun executes `.ts` natively) and then dies with `Executable not found in $PATH: "npm"` on a
 * machine that has only Bun. Two signals, in order:
 *
 *   1. `npm_config_user_agent` — every major package manager sets it when running a script, and its
 *      first token is the manager's name (`bun/1.3.14 …`, `npm/11.17.0 …`). This is authoritative
 *      when the gate was reached via `<manager> run check:all`, which is the normal path.
 *   2. The runtime itself — when the script is invoked DIRECTLY (`bun scripts/gate.ts`) no user
 *      agent is set, but a `Bun` global means we are under Bun and should use it.
 *
 * Falls back to npm, which is correct for `node scripts/gate.ts` on a normal Node install.
